# Obsidian Encrypt Plugin

**Create encrypted notes within your [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) vault.**

Encrypted notes are never decrypted to disk giving you peace-of-mind that the decrypted contents haven't been sync'd or backed up to external systems.


> ⚠️ WARNING - Use at your own risk ⚠️
> - Your passwords are never stored anywhere, if you forget your passwords you can't decrypt your notes.
> - No known audits have been undertaken for the soundness of encryption methods being used.  Unwanted decryption by a 3rd party may be possible if they have access to your files.
> - Bugs could be introduced to the software at anytime, you are responsible for having backups of your notes.
